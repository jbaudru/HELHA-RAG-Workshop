To engage local stakeholders, departments have been leading territorial engagement committees (CTEs) since July 2023.

Paris 2024 supports the communities in their deliberation on the activations that can be implemented on the day of the Relay in their area.

Action sheets, presenting various activation ideas, have been provided to the concerned communities.
