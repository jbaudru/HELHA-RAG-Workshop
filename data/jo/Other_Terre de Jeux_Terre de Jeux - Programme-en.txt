OnhZDqk8-en; en; What is the Terre de Jeux 2024 programme?; Terre de Jeux is a programme intended for all levels of local authorities, the sports movement (federations, regional sports committees, departmental sports committees), and embassies who wish, regardless of their size and means, to engage in the adventure of the Games.

This free programme is intended to highlight their good practices and to encourage even more sports involvement in daily life, everywhere in the UK.

Beyond a commitment to the values and ambition of Paris 2024, the entities awarded the label undertake to implement or deploy programs related to sports.

The actions undertaken by the labelled entities are tailored to their size and means: simple actions for the smallest municipalities, more elaborate actions for regions or federations, for example.

terredejeux.paris2024.org [http://terredejeux.paris2024.org/]



It has been designed to be simple and quick. The possibility of obtaining the programme does not require a vote from the municipal council.

Once the application is submitted, you will receive a confirmation email (please check your spam folder).



One month after your application, if you have not received anything, we invite you to contact our team at:

terredejeux2024@paris2024.org.
