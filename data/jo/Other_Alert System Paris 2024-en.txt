It's called "Ma sécurité" and it lets you talk to a gendarme or police officer 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can find a video presentation here [https://app.frame.io/presentations/82e98889-0c52-4e19-ac6b-1717c4d5f96b]



You can use it to take all the necessary steps, such as lodging a complaint online (particularly if you have been the victim of a scam involving the purchase of counterfeit notes), or making a report.



You can also :

 * Obtain information on the perimeter and security arrangements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

 * Find a gendarmerie or police station nearby.
