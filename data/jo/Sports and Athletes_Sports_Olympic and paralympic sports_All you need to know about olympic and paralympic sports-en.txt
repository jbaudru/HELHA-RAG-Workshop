The Paralympic Games classification system ensures fair competitions for all participants.

When an athlete competes in a Paralympic Games event, they are firstly entered into a disability category governed by a classification system.

This classification is carried out by professionals in the medical and technical fields, tasked with assessing the impact of the disability on the athlete's sports gesture and performance.

There is no common classification system for all sports. Due to their history and the nature of their practice, each discipline has its own system.

Oh9KoC2p-en; en; What is the qualification system for the Olympic and Paralympic Games?; Qualifications for the Olympic and Paralympic Games are defined by the IOC (International Olympic Committee) or the IPC (International Paralympic Committee) and the International Federations.



This set of actors is part of the qualification process establishing as a reference the Qualification Principles :

https://olympics.com/ioc/documents/olympic-games/paris-2024-olympic-games



Each sport has an official document called Qualification System (in the case of the Olympics) and Qualification Regulations (in the case of the Paralympics) and it defines all the detailed guidelines and procedures to be followed for an individual athlete or a team to qualify in this precise sport, discipline, and event. These documents created by each International Federation indicate a maximum number of participants per organization, per gender, per event, etc. A qualification can be obtained through a nominal quota (Qualification obtained by the Athlete name) or a slot (The Organization (NOC/NPC) can choose which athletes can participate in the competition).

In addition, there are several types of qualification methods for each sport:

 * ranking

 * qualification tournament

 * continental championship

 * world championship, etc



Once these rules are applied, it is necessary to take into account the period of time defined as qualification periods.



As an example, World Athletics has set its own tool to follow Paris 2024 Qualifications for The Olympic Games :
