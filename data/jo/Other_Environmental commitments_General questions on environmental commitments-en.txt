qWDz7_m1-en; en; Does the organizing committee work with climate and environmental experts?; Within Paris 2024, the Environmental Excellence Department, made up of specialists in carbon impact reduction, biodiversity, the circular economy, energy and communication on climate and environmental issues, will support the various Games business lines in integrating these issues into every aspect of the event's organization.



In addition, to provide an external perspective on the work carried out, the "Committee for the Ecological Transformation of the Games" was created in 2021.

It is made up of personalities representing the Games' stakeholders and recognized experts.

qWFBcaGE-en; en; What legacy will the Games leave behind for more responsible sporting events?; Organizing Games that leave a legacy means both guaranteeing the circularity of resources and infrastructures and working on the sustainability of Paris 2024's methods.



To make the Games a real kick-start for the ecological transformation of sport, Paris 2024 is sharing its tools with the many players involved in delivering the Games - partner or service provider companies, host communities hosting competition venues or communities awarded the Terre de Jeux label offering events on their territories... - and supporting those who are taking action to help sport players make the transition.



These resources are also made available to all those involved in events and sport, so that we can leave a legacy beyond the Games.

qWFXvSu_-en; en; What is the Event Climate Coach?; The Events Climate Coach is a free online tool for sports event organizers wishing to estimate and reduce their carbon impact.

Like a real coach, the tool proposes a personalized program of concrete actions to reduce the event's carbon emissions.



It was developed by Paris 2024, in collaboration with the French Ministry of Sports and Olympic and Paralympic Games, the French National Olympic and Sports Committee (CNOSF), and with the support of ADEME.



It is available free of charge here:

Onl4Lz3g-en; en; What happens to the IT equipment after the Games?; To minimise the purchase of new equipment, the Committee relies heavily on leasing.

Depending on their condition, the thousands of computers, phones, screens, or printers will have a second life after the Games through reuse or refurbishment.



Paris 2024 is committed to giving a second life to 100% of the purchased equipment, in particular through resale to sports event organisers.

SCC, an Official Supporter of the Games, will also be responsible for buying back or refurbishing the equipment, relying on repair, reconditioning and redistribution organisations, as well as the recycling channels of the social economy.; Other;Environmental commitments;General questions on environmental commitments; https://help.paris2024.org/en-gb/contents/What-happens-to-the-IT-equipment-after-the-Games-Onl4Lz3g
qWBszQdF-en; en; How are the Games' carbon output calculated?; Paris 2024 has set itself the target of dividing the Games' carbon emissions in half compared to previous editions, using the widest possible scope (scope 3), which includes indirect emissions such as spectator travel.



For the calculation, the CO2 emissions of each of the products and services linked to the event are added together, using the "emission factors" in the ADEME Carbon Base [https://base-empreinte.ademe.fr/].



Over 2,000 indicators, such as the breakdown of tickets sold by country or the quantities of IT equipment required, are regularly updated as the project progresses.



The final carbon footprint of the Games will be known and published by Paris 2024 after the event, thanks to the integration of data including spectator origin and modes of transport.

qWEM0Ci8-en; en; What will happen to the Athletes' Village after the Games?; Built on a former industrial wasteland bordering the communes of Saint-Denis, Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine and L'Ã®le-Saint-Denis, the Athletes' Village was first designed for the area.

A project that existed prior to the Games itself, it has been improved and accelerated thanks to the Games, and will be one of the main physical legacies.



By 2025, it will be transformed into a sustainable city district, with housing, offices and shops, where almost 12,000 people will live and work.

Solutions for low-carbon construction and a site adapted to the climatic conditions of 2050 include triple glazing, cooling floors, green spaces and geothermal energy.



During the Games, it will be equipped by Paris 2024 to accommodate the 15,000 athletes, using modular partitions that will be re-used and furniture whose second-life solutions will be identified before the Games.

qWEu-87o-en; en; What will happen to the temporary venues after the Games?; Paris 2024 has chosen to rely on 95% existing or temporary infrastructure for the Games.

At the end of the event, all materials and structures installed on a temporary basis will be repurposed, reused or recycled.

qWDZzQq9-en; en; Will the Paris 2024 Games be carbon free?; As stated by ADEME since 2022, the notion of "carbon neutrality" - i.e., emitting no more emissions than the planet or a territory can absorb - can only be applied on a global or territorial scale.

To contribute to carbon neutrality, all organizations must participate in the reduction effort, and can support projects to combat climate change.



On its own scale, Paris 2024 has set itself the target of cutting event-related CO2 emissions in half, by taking action in all areas of the organization. For those emissions that cannot be avoided, the Organizing Committee has chosen to finance projects that will help combat global warming while providing co-benefits for local populations and biodiversity.

These include reforestation, forest preservation and renewable energy development projects.



In line with ADEME's recommendation on climate-related communications, Paris 2024 no longer uses the expression "carbon-neutral" Games, without lowering its ambitions in this area.

qWC7-8uf-en; en; What are the main actions taken to reduce the carbon impact of the Games?; Paris 2024 is working at all levels to reduce the carbon impact of the event, by anticipating and reducing needs, and by proposing solutions that generate less CO2.

The Games are therefore based on a more economical concept: existing infrastructures, complemented by temporary venues built using low-carbon materials such as wood and served by public transport.



Paris 2024 has also chosen to connect the venues to the electricity grid to avoid the use of polluting diesel generators, to supply the venues with 100% renewable energy and to offer twice as much vegetation in the catering.
