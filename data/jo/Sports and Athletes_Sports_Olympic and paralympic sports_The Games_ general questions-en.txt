OnlXaCqF-en; en; What are the paralympic classifications?; Classifications are essential to ensure fairness between athletes within events.



When athletes compete in a paralympic competition, they are first classified in a disability category governed by a classification system. This classification is carried out by medical and technical professionals whose job is to assess the impact of the disability on the athlete's sporting ability and performance.



There is no common classification system for all sports, because of their history and the way they are practised, each discipline has its own system.; Sports and Athletes;Sports;Olympic and paralympic sports;The Games: general questions; https://help.paris2024.org/en-gb/contents/What-are-the-paralympic-classifications-OnlXaCqF

OnnODtqy-en; en; How does paralympic classification work?; When athletes compete in a paralympic competition, they are first classified into a disability category governed by a classification system.



The classification system adheres to a common logic with 2 components:

 * Letter: one or two letters referring to the sport.

 * Number: a number associated with these letters. The higher the number, the less severe the disability, and vice versa.

OnlZTAiR-en; en; Why don't the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games take place at the same time?; The Olympic and Paralympic Games are held on different dates to avoid diluting the importance of the Paralympic event.

Furthermore, the logistics and costs involved in simultaneously organizing both events without reducing the number of participants or competitions would be monumental. Additionally, organizing them at the same time would not allow for as much visibility for Paralympic athletes, who are still relatively unknown to the public.

The Paralympic Games are not held before the Olympic Games because they are not meant to serve as a test before the Olympic Games.

Almost all the competition venues will be identical between the Paralympic and Olympic Games, except for the road events.
