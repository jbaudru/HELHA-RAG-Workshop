2JI0kXUX-en; en; Who stays at the Athletes' Village in Seine-Saint-Denis?; Built on a former industrial wasteland spanning the municipalities of Saint-Denis, Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, and L'Île-Saint-Denis, the Athletes' Village was initially conceived for the local area.

A pre-existing project before the Olympic bid, it has been enhanced and expedited thanks to the Games and will be one of its main tangible legacies.

Starting from 2025, it will be transformed into a sustainable urban neighborhood, comprising residential units, offices, and shops where nearly 12,000 people will live and work.

Among the solutions for low-carbon constructions and a site adapted to the climate conditions of 2050: triple glazing, cooling floors, green spaces, and geothermal energy.

During the Games, it will be set up by Paris 2024 to accommodate 15,000 athletes, using modular partitions that will be reused and furniture with second-life solutions identified before the Games.
