3JI5QkgK-en; en; How will the temporary installations of Paris 2024 be managed in the center of Paris?; The temporary sites of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the centre of Paris will be installed and dismantled in phased manner with a progressive approach:

Geographical phasing: During the assembly and disassembly phases, the ground area of the installations will be progressively expanded.

Time phasing: The perimeters of the competition sites will be gradually activated and deactivated from the assembly phases to the disassembly phases.

This will help minimize disruptions to traffic lanes and access to public spaces before and after the Games.
